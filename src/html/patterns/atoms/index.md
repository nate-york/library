In chemistry, atoms are the basic building blocks of matter. They have distinct properties and can't be broken down further without losing their meaning.

Translated to interfaces, atoms are basic tags, such as form labels, inputs or buttons. They also include more abstract elements like color palettes, fonts, and animations.
